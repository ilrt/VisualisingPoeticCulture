# Visualising the poetic cultures of 18th periodicals

## Setup

You need to create a ```private_settings.py``` file a variable called ```database_zip_url``` 
which is assigned the URL of a DropBox link. The URL should end in ```dl=1```. For example:

```python
database_zip_url = 'https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l5kfrez2js5ckbm/GhCfdfGGHvbvbfFGTvvv?dl=1'
```
